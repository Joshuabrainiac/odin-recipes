# What is this project about

This is going to be my HTML project with TOP. After
this, I am moving on to CSS. Hmmm!

Well the meat of this project is that it gives me a 
provision to practice all that I have learned with 
The Odin Project on HTML.

It's going to prove that i really know what I am 
doing.

I go!
